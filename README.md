## Contributing

### Contributing bugs, ideas and help
1.  **Bugs** come in two flavours: non-critical and critical. Non-critical bugs are those that sometimes can mean a nuisance but that do not seriously affect working with the app. Critical bugs, however, make Calcify barely or un-usable, and fixes need to be addressed urgently. Normally, the latter is taken on by the core-team.
2.  **Enhancements** are some small additions that require adding some more functionality to a feature, but that should not evolve into an own distinct feature. Even if the issue description reads like a full feature to you, the "enhancement" label means there is already said functionality, which just needs to be amended. Please ask if you are unsure.
3.  **Features** are bigger additions to the application that require a completely new feature. These can take some time, but could also prove to be a nice winter project.

If you know where the bug is in the code, or even have an idea how to fix it, feel free to share your idea with me.

### Contributing docs
The documentation always changes with every new feature I release, so keeping it up to date is of utmost importance. To help with our documentation, [see its repository](https://github.com/tonif03/calcify-docs). Just fork it and edit everything where you spot mistakes. You can also add feature explanations if something is missing.
Another important thing is to translate the documentation to other languages to make it accessible for everyone.
